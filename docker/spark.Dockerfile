# Base image for every Spark workload in this project: the speed-layer
# streaming job (processing/stream_job.py), the raw archiver
# (processing/raw_archiver.py), and the batch job (processing/batch_job.py,
# invoked from inside the Airflow container which uses this same jar cache).
# Pinned to Debian 12 "bookworm": the floating `python:3.11-slim` tag moved to
# Debian 13, which no longer packages openjdk-17 (build fails with "no
# installation candidate"), and Spark 3.5 + the JAVA_HOME below expect JDK 17.
