# Lightweight image for pure-Python services that do NOT need a JVM/PySpark:
# the two ingestion producers (Phase 2) and the FastAPI serving app (Phase 5).
# Kept separate from docker/spark.Dockerfile so these containers start in a
# couple of seconds instead of carrying a JDK + Spark install they never use.
