Thin PostgreSQL helpers shared by every Spark job and the Airflow DAGs.

Deliberately NOT an ORM -- every write in this pipeline is either a simple
upsert (heartbeat) or a bulk COPY-like insert done inside a Spark
`foreachBatch`, where a lightweight `psycopg2` connection per micro-batch is
both simpler and faster than standing up SQLAlchemy inside executors.
